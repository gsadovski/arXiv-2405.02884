First of all, we would like to express our gratitude to the referee for taking the time to read and evaluate our work. Their comments are entirely pertinent and significantly contribute to the improvement of the manuscript. However, there are two misunderstandings in the referee’s interpretation that we believe require clarification. We are confident that these clarifications sufficiently justify our ideas and results, thereby making the paper suitable for publication in _The European Physical Journal C_.

The first point that needs to be clarified is that the effective gravity obtained does not arise from a spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism, but rather an explicit breaking of the topological BRST symmetry. This distinction also helps to address the other concerns raised by the referee. In fact, one central idea is that the fields $X$ and $Y$ are not quantum fields, but rather external Symanzik sources (see K. Symanzik, Commun. Math. Phys. 16 (1970) 48–80).

The core philosophy of Symanzik's technique is to control symmetry breaking by introducing external fields, which later assume particular, generally non-vanishing, values. If these were genuine quantum fields appearing in the integration measure, the referee’s concerns would indeed be correct. We acknowledge the confusion likely originated from our omission of this crucial point in the original version of this manuscript.

To clarify further, we would like to highlight the following:

- The fields $X$ and $Y$ are introduced as external sources. Since they are not part of the integration measure in the path integral, they cannot be interpreted as Lagrange multipliers enforcing a gauge fixing condition;

- As external sources, $X$ and $Y$ do not possess their own field equations. They are classical background fields, fixed independently of the dynamical content of the theory;

- These sources assume physical values at the end of the process (expressions (24a) and (24b)). This marks a key difference between Symanzik and Schwinger sources: Symanzik sources are not required to vanish at the end of a computation;

- Another perspective on the Symanzik method is to regard $S\vert_{\text{phys}}$ (in expression 25) as the starting point. This gravitational theory, known to suffer from renormalizability issues, is often dismissed as a viable candidate for a perturbative quantum theory of gravity. The Symanzik framework introduces external sources specifically to restore a symmetry that is not originally present --- the topological BRST. The gravitational theory, invariant under the weaker Yang-Mills BRST, is thus embedded in a more general framework, where perturbative computations yield meaningful results. Once calculations are performed, non-vanishing values are imposed on the sources, so that $S\vert_{\text{phys}}$ is recovered;

- When the Symanzik sources are assigned specific non-vanishing values, the topological symmetry is explicitly broken and the gravitational degrees of freedom emerge;

- In summary, the Symanzik source method enables us to embed gravity in a larger theoretical framework that supports consistent perturbative computations. By setting the physical values of the sources, at the end, the Lovelock-Cartan theory of gravity is recovered.

We also would like to emphasize that the Symanzik method is well established in field theory and widely employed across various domains. For example, it is extensively used in the treatment of the Gribov problem to control BRST symmetry breaking (see N. Vandersickel, D. Zwanziger, Phys. Rept. 520 (2012) 175–251, and references therein). Another example is its application in Lorentz-violating models (e.g., T. R. S. Santos, R. F. Sobreiro, Phys. Rev. D 91 (2015) 025008; T. R. S. Santos, R. F. Sobreiro, Braz. J. Phys. 46 (2016) 437–452).

To make explicitly clear that $X$ and $Y$ are Symanzik sources --- classical external fields --- we made the following modifications to the original manuscript (which have been highlighted in boldface type style):

- In the first paragraph of Section 3.2, we explicitly state that $X$ and $Y$ are classical external fields introduced due to Symanzik's technique. And, Symanzik's original work was added as a citation;
- Table 2 caption now calls $X$ and $Y$ "Symanzik sources";
- A new paragraph has been inserted in Section 3.3, between equations (25) and (26), which briefly explains Symanzik's technique. This paragraph is accompanied by a footnote establishing the wide use of Symanzik's technique in pertubative QFT --- several citations were added;
- We also have performed minor changes along the text to fix typographical and punctuation errors (not highlighted).

We trust that the above clarifications adequately address the referee’s concerns and that the manuscript is now suitable for publication in EPJC.

Finally, we would once again like to thank the referee and the editors for the opportunity to have our work considered for publication.

Yours sincerely,

The authors.
