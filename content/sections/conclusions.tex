\section{Conclusions}%
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this work, we proposed an $ SO \left( 4 \right) $ TYM theory, defined by~\eqref{eq:tg+sb}, as topological phase of gravity. The TYM BRST symmetry transformations~\eqref{eq:top_grav_brst}, play a pivotal role in this context. They \textquote{freeze} the local gravitational dynamics into the physically trivial $s$-boundary term~\eqref{eq:s-boundary_action}. In this topological phase, the gravitational observables that remain are related to the smoothness of spacetime --- which automatically makes them conformally invariant.

The unprecedented $ s $-boundary term~\eqref{eq:s-boundary_action}, vital to the connection to gravity, has the potential to spoil the renormalizability features of $ SO(4) $ TYM.\@ In Section~\ref{sec:quantum}, the quantum stability of the proposed model is worked out in the extended (A){}SDL gauge~\eqref{eq:extended-asdlg}. Remarkably, the model remains renormalizable to all orders in perturbative theory, and contains 7 independent renormalizations~\eqref{eq:ct-action}.

Key features of topological quantum field theories remain explicit in the present model. For instance, the complete set of Ward identities of traditional QTYM, in the (A){}SDL gauge, is present here --- albeit corrected to account for the presence of~\eqref{eq:s-boundary_action}. We found that this strong set of symmetries implies that the gauge field does not renormalize, $ z_{ \omega } = 1 $. This result is compatible with the vanishing of $ \langle \omega(x) \omega(y) \rangle $ to all orders in perturbation theory. The latter is a known feature of traditional QTYM in the (A){}SDL gauge~\cite{sadovski2017c,sadovski2018a}. This is yet another reflection of the physical content of the theory being non-local in the bulk and/or living in the boundary.

The connection between the proposed topological phase and the Lovelock-Cartan family of gravity theories is explained in Section~\ref{ssec:from_top_to_grav;sec:top_grav}. And, it boils down to a dynamical implementation of the horizontal condition, $ \psi = \phi = 0 $. This condition deforms the TYM BRST into the traditional YM BRST.\@ Local observables in the bulk --- incompatible with the TYM BRST --- are now allowed by the YM BRST.\@ Most remarkably, the proposed implementation also identifies these bulky local degrees of freedom as gravitational ones.

The detailed nature of the mass parameter $ \mu $ in~\eqref{eq:physicalsource2} is left open. Several mass generation mechanisms, well known in the context of non-Abelian gauge theories, can be employed to explain its origin, and to predict its current theoretical value. The viability of the model can then be tested by comparison to most current the experimental value of $ m_{ \text{P} } $, and the most current observational value of $ \Lambda^2 $, via~\eqref{eq:correspondence}. This investigation will be carried out by the authors in a follow-up work.
