  ABSTRACT = {Motivated by string dualities we propose topological gravity as the early phase of our universe. The topological nature of this phase naturally leads to the explanation of many of the puzzles of early universe cosmology. A concrete realization of this scenario using Witten{'}s four dimensional topological gravity is considered. This model leads to the power spectrum of CMB fluctuations which is controlled by the conformal anomaly coefficients {$a,\; c$}. In particular the strength of the fluctuation is controlled by { $1/a$} and its tilt by {$cg^2$} where {$g$} is the coupling constant of topological gravity. The positivity of {$c$}, a consequence of unitarity, leads automatically to an IR tilt for the power spectrum. In contrast with standard inflationary models, this scenario predicts {$O(1)$} non-Gaussianities for four- and higher-point correlators and the absence of tensor modes in the CMB fluctuations.},

  ABSTRACT = {We study the Gribov problem in four-dimensional topological Yang-Mills theories following the Baulieu-Singer approach in the (anti-)self-dual Landau gauges. As suggested by the tree-level exactness of the model in this gauge choice, the Gribov copies are shown to be inoffensive at the quantum level. To be more precise, following Gribov, we discuss the path integral restriction to the Gribov horizon. The associated gap equation, which fixes the so-called Gribov parameter, is however shown to only possess a trivial solution, making the restriction obsolete. We relate this to the absence of radiative corrections in both gauge and ghost sectors. We give further evidence by employing the renormalization group which shows that, for this kind of topological model, the gap equation indeed forbids the introduction of a massive Gribov parameter.},

The Lagrangian is required to be: (i) a D-form scalar under local Lorentz transformations; (ii) a local polynomial of the vielbein, the spin connection, and their exterior derivatives; (iii) constructed without the Hodge dual (*-operation). Besides the purely metric Lovelock action, there is a series of torsion terms related to the Pontryagin classes in a way analogous to the relation between the Lovelock action and the Euler classes. Also, a family of global invariants of the differentiable structure of the manifold, constructed with the torsion, is identified. Relaxing the condition of invariance of the Lagrangian under local Lorentz rotations, but still requiring the action to be invariant, another family of torsional actions that generalizes the Chern-Simons theories is found. Systematic algorithms for the explicit construction of these actions are provided.},

The model is originally composed by a topological sector and a BRST exact piece and has no explicit dependence on the metric, the vierbein or a mass parameter. The vierbein is introduced together with a mass parameter through some BRST trivial constraints. The effect of the constraints is to identify the vierbein with some of the additional fields, transforming the original action into the Lovelock-Cartan one. In this scenario, the mass parameter is identified with Newton{'}s constant while the gauge field is identified with the spin-connection. The symmetries of the model are also explored. Moreover, the extension of the model to a quantum version is qualitatively discussed.},

  ABSTRACT = {It is known that if gauge conditions have Gribov zero modes, then topological symmetry is broken. In this paper we apply it to topological gravity in dimension {$ n \ge 3 $}. Our choice of the gauge condition for conformal invariance is {$ R + \alpha = 0 $}, where {$ R $} is the Ricci scalar curvature. We find when {$ \alpha \neq 0 $}, topological symmetry is not broken, but when {$\alpha = 0 $} and solutions of the Einstein equations exist then topological symmetry is broken. This conditions connect to the Yamabe conjecture. Namely negative constant scalar curvature exist on manifolds of any topology, but existence of nonnegative constant scalar curvature is restricted by topology. This fact is easily seen in this theory. Topological symmetry breaking means that BRS symmetry breaking in cohomological field theory. But it is found that another BRS symmetry can be defined and physical states are redefined. The divergence due to the Gribov zero modes is regularized, and the theory after topological symmetry breaking become semiclassical Einstein gravitational theory under a special definition of observables.},

  ABSTRACT = {There are essentially two different approaches to the axiomatization of quantum field theory (QFT): algebraic QFT, going back to Haag and Kastler, and functorial QFT, going back to Atiyah and Segal. More recently, based on ideas by Baez and Dolan, the latter is being refined to \mkbibquote{extended} functorial QFT by Freed, Hopkins, Lurie and others. The first approach uses local nets of operator algebras which assign to each patch an algebra \mkbibquote{of observables}, the latter uses { $n$}-functors which assign to each patch a \mkbibquote{propagator of states}. In this note we present an observation about how these two axiom systems are naturally related: we demonstrate under mild assumptions that every 2-dimensional extended Minkowskian QFT 2-functor (\mkbibquote{parallel surface transport}) naturally yields a local net. This is obtained by postcomposing the propagation 2-functor with an operation that mimics the passage from the \textit{Schrödinger picture} to the \textit{Heisenberg picture} in quantum mechanics. The argument has a straightforward generalization to general Lorentzian structure, bare lightcone structure and higher dimensions. It does not, however, by itself imply anything about the existence of a vacuum state or about positive energy representations.},

  ABSTRACT = {This book grew out of a set of lecture notes on gravitational Chern–Simons (CS) theories developed over the past decade for several schools and different audiences including graduate students and researchers. CS theories are gauge-invariant theories that can include gravity consistently. They are only defined in odd dimensions and represent a very special class of theories in the Lovelock family. Lovelock gravitation theories are the natural extensions of General Relativity for dimensions greater than four that yield second-order field equations for the metric. These theories also admit local supersymmetric extensions where supersymmetry is an off-shell symmetry of the action, as in a standard gauge theory. Apart from the arguments of mathematical elegance and beauty, the gravitational CS actions are exceptionally endowed with physical attributes that suggest the viability of a quantum interpretation. CS theories are gauge-invariant , scale-invariant and background independent; they have no dimensional coupling constants. All constants in the Lagrangian are fixed rational coefficients that cannot be adjusted without destroying gauge invariance. This exceptional status of CS systems makes them classically interesting to study, and quantum mechanically intriguing and promising.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this review, we consider first-order gravity in four dimensions. In particular, we focus our attention in formulations where the fundamental variables are a tetrad {$ \tensor{e }{^I_a}$} and a {$ SO(3,1) $} connection {$ \tensor{\omega}{_{aI}^J} $}. We study the most general action principle compatible with diffeomorphism invariance. This implies, in particular, considering besides the standard Einstein–Hilbert–Palatini term, other terms that either do not change the equations of motion, or are topological in nature. Having a well defined action principle sometimes involves the need for additional boundary terms , whose detailed form may depend on the particular boundary conditions at hand. In this work, we consider spacetimes that include a boundary at infinity, satisfying asymptotically flat boundary conditions and/or an internal boundary satisfying isolated horizons boundary conditions. We focus on the covariant Hamiltonian formalism where the phase space {$ \Gamma $} is given by solutions to the equations of motion. For each of the possible terms contributing to the action, we consider the well-posedness of the action, its finiteness, the contribution to the symplectic structure, and the Hamiltonian and Noether charges. For the chosen boundary conditions, standard boundary terms warrant a well posed theory. Furthermore, the boundary and topological terms do not contribute to the symplectic structure, nor the Hamiltonian conserved charges. The Noether conserved charges, on the other hand, do depend on such additional terms. The aim of this manuscript is to present a comprehensive and self-contained treatment of the subject, so the style is somewhat pedagogical. Furthermore, along the way, we point out and clarify some issues that have not been clearly understood in the literature.},

  ABSTRACT = {In a spacetime with nonvanishing torsion there can occur topologically stable configurations associated with the frame bundle which are independent of the curvature. The relevant topological invariants are integrals of local scalar densities first discussed by Nieh and Yan (N-Y). In four dimensions, the N-Y form {$ N = \left( T_a T^a - R_{ab} e^a e^b \right) $} is the only closed 4-form invariant under local Lorentz rotations associated with the torsion of the manifold. The integral of {$ N $} over a compact {$ D $}-dimensional (Euclidean) manifold is shown to be a topological invariant related to the Pontryagin classes of {$ SO(D+1) $} and {$ SO(D) $}. An explicit example of a topologically nontrivial configuration carrying nonvanishing instanton number proportional to {$ \int N $} is constructed. The chiral anomaly in a four-dimensional spacetime with torsion is also shown to contain a contribution proportional to {$ N $}, besides the usual Pontryagin density related to the spacetime curvature. The violation of chiral symmetry can thus depend on the instanton number of the tangent frame bundle of the manifold. Similar invariants can be constructed in {$ D>4 $} dimensions and the existence of the corresponding nontrivial excitations is also discussed.},

  ABSTRACT = {Curvature and torsion are the two tensors characterizing a general Riemannian space–time. In Einstein{'}s general theory of gravitation, with torsion postulated to vanish and the affine connection identified to the Christoffel symbol, only the curvature tensor plays the central role. For such a purely metric geometry , two well-known topological invariants, namely the Euler class and the Pontryagin class, are useful in characterizing the topological properties of the space–time. From a gauge theory point of view, and especially in the presence of spin, torsion naturally comes into play, and the underlying space–time is no longer purely metric. We describe a torsional topological invariant, discovered in 1982, that has now found increasing usefulness in recent developments.},

@BOOK{piguet1995b,
  ABSTRACT = {The idea of this book originated from two series of lectures given by us at the Physics Department of the Catholic University of Petr{ ô}polis, in Brazil. Its aim is to present an introduction to the \mkbibquote{algebraic} method in the perturbative renormalization of relativistic quantum field theory. Although this approach goes back to the pioneering works of Symanzik in the early 1970s and was systematized by Becchi, Rouet and Stora as early as 1972-1974, its full value has not yet been widely appreciated by the practitioners of quantum field theory. Becchi, Rouet and Stora have, however, shown it to be a powerful tool for proving the renormalizability of theories with (broken) symmetries and of gauge theories. We have thus found it pertinent to collect in a self-contained manner the available information on algebraic renormalization, which was previously scattered in many original papers and in a few older review articles. Although we have taken care to adapt the level of this book to that of a postgraduate (Ph.D.) course, more advanced researchers will also certainly find it useful. The deeper knowledge of renormalization theory we hope readers will acquire should help them to face the difficult problems of quantum field theory. It should also be very helpful to the more phenomenology oriented readers who want to familiarize themselves with the formalism of renormalization theory, a necessity in view of the sophisticated perturbative calculations currently being done, in particular in the standard model of particle interactions.},
