  ABSTRACT = {A variant of the usual supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model is described, governing maps from a Riemann surface {$\Sigma$}; to an arbitrary almost complex manifold {$M$}. It possesses a fermionic BRST-like symmetry, conserved for arbitrary {$\Sigma$ }, and obeying {$Q^2=0$}. In a suitable version, the quantum ground states are the {$(1+1)$} dimensional Floer groups. The correlation functions of the BRST-invariant operators are invariants (depending only on the homotopy type of the almost complex structure of {$M$}) similar to those that have entered in recent work of Gromov on symplectic geometry. The model can be coupled to dynamical gravitational or gauge fields while preserving the fermionic symmetry; some observations by Atiyah suggest that the latter coupling may be related to the Jones polynomial of knot theory. From the point of view of string theory, the main novelty of this type of sigma model is that the graviton vertex operator is a BRST commutator. Thus, models of this type may correspond to a realization at the level of string theory of an unbroken phase of quantum gravity.},

  ABSTRACT = {We study the Gribov problem in four-dimensional topological Yang-Mills theories following the Baulieu-Singer approach in the (anti-)self-dual Landau gauges. As suggested by the tree-level exactness of the model in this gauge choice, the Gribov copies are shown to be inoffensive at the quantum level. To be more precise, following Gribov, we discuss the path integral restriction to the Gribov horizon. The associated gap equation, which fixes the so-called Gribov parameter, is however shown to only possess a trivial solution, making the restriction obsolete. We relate this to the absence of radiative corrections in both gauge and ghost sectors. We give further evidence by employing the renormalization group which shows that, for this kind of topological model, the gap equation indeed forbids the introduction of a massive Gribov parameter.},

  ABSTRACT = {We characterize the correspondence between the twisted {$ N=2 $} super-Yang-Mills theory and the Baulieu-Singer topological theory quantized in the self-dual Landau gauges. While the first is based on an on-shell supersymmetry , the second is based on an off-shell Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin symmetry. Because of the equivariant cohomology, the twisted {$ N=2 $} in the ultraviolet regime and Baulieu-Singer theories share the same observables, the Donaldson invariants for 4-manifolds. The triviality of the Gribov copies in the Baulieu-Singer theory in these gauges shows that working in the instanton moduli space on the twisted {$ N=2 $} side is equivalent to working in the self-dual gauges on the Baulieu-Singer one. After proving the vanishing of the {$ \beta $} function in the Baulieu-Singer theory, we conclude that the twisted {$ N=2 $} in the ultraviolet regime, in any Riemannian manifold, is correspondent to the Baulieu-Singer theory in the self-dual Landau gauges—a conformal gauge theory defined in Euclidean flat space.},

If so, and one takes at face value the minimum mass of a BTZ black hole, then the energy spectrum of three-dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant can be determined exactly. At the most negative possible value of the cosmological constant, the dual CFT is very likely the monster theory of Frenkel, Lepowsky, and Meurman. The monster theory may be the first in a discrete series of CFT{'}s that are dual to three-dimensional gravity.

Both frameworks arose in the context of quantum gravity research, and can be understood as higher-dimensional generalizations of matrix models. We describe the common combinatorial structure underlying such models and review some of the key mathematical results that have been obtained in this area. Of central importance is the discovery of a new family of large {$ N $} expansions for random tensors. It has driven applications of tensor models to random geometry and non-perturbative local quantum field theory, and has also enabled the development of rigorous renormalization methods for group field theories and other non-local quantum field theories.},

  ABSTRACT = {We discuss universal properties of conformal field theories with holographic duals. A central feature of these theories is the existence of a low-lying sector of operators whose correlators factorize. We demonstrate that factorization can only hold in the large central charge limit. Using conformal invariance and factorization we argue that these operators are naturally represented as fields in AdS as this makes the underlying linearity of the system manifest. In this class of CFTs the solution of the conformal bootstrap conditions can be naturally organized in structures which coincide with Witten diagrams in the bulk. The large value of the central charge suggests that the theory must include a large number of new operators not captured by the factorized sector. Consequently we may think of the AdS hologram as an effective representation of a small sector of the CFT, which is embedded inside a much larger Hilbert space corresponding to the black hole microstates.},

  ABSTRACT = {We review the various aspects of the 3D Einstein gravity theory with a negative cosmological constant and its boundary description. We also explore its connections to conformal field theories (CFTs), modular symmetry, and holography. It is worth noting that this particular theory is topological in nature, which means that all the physical degrees of freedom are located on the boundary. Additionally, we can derive the boundary description on a torus, which takes the form of a 2D Schwarzian theory. This observation suggests that the relevant degrees of freedom for the theory can be described using this 2D theory. Because of the renormalizability of the 3D gravity theory, one can probe the quantum regime. This suggests that it is possible to investigate quantum phenomena. Unlike the conventional CFTs, when considering the {$ AdS_3 $} background, the boundary theory loses modular symmetry. This represents a departure from the usual behavior of CFT and is quite intriguing. The Weyl transformation induces anomaly in CFTs, and we indicate that applying this transformation to the 2D Schwarzian theory leads to similar results. Summing over all geometries with the asymptotic {$ AdS_3 $} boundary condition is equivalent to summing over a modular group. The partition function is one-loop exact and therefore an analytical expression from the summation. This theory holds potential applications in Quantum Information and is a recurring theme in the study of holography, where gravitational theories are connected with CFTs.},

  ABSTRACT = {It is known that if gauge conditions have Gribov zero modes, then topological symmetry is broken. In this paper we apply it to topological gravity in dimension {$ n \ge 3 $}. Our choice of the gauge condition for conformal invariance is {$ R + \alpha = 0 $}, where {$ R $} is the Ricci scalar curvature. We find when {$ \alpha \neq 0 $}, topological symmetry is not broken, but when {$\alpha = 0 $} and solutions of the Einstein equations exist then topological symmetry is broken. This conditions connect to the Yamabe conjecture. Namely negative constant scalar curvature exist on manifolds of any topology, but existence of nonnegative constant scalar curvature is restricted by topology. This fact is easily seen in this theory. Topological symmetry breaking means that BRS symmetry breaking in cohomological field theory. But it is found that another BRS symmetry can be defined and physical states are redefined. The divergence due to the Gribov zero modes is regularized, and the theory after topological symmetry breaking become semiclassical Einstein gravitational theory under a special definition of observables.},

The model is originally composed by a topological sector and a BRST exact piece and has no explicit dependence on the metric, the vierbein or a mass parameter. The vierbein is introduced together with a mass parameter through some BRST trivial constraints. The effect of the constraints is to identify the vierbein with some of the additional fields, transforming the original action into the Lovelock-Cartan one. In this scenario, the mass parameter is identified with Newton{'}s constant while the gauge field is identified with the spin-connection. The symmetries of the model are also explored. Moreover, the extension of the model to a quantum version is qualitatively discussed.},

  ABSTRACT = {Quantum field theory successfully explains the origin of all fundamental forces except gravity due to the renormalizability and ultraviolet(UV) completion puzzles. The ADS/CFT correspondence conjecture might naturally resolve the above two puzzles for ADS space gravity. In this paper, we propose a topological scenario to resolve the above two puzzles for generic cases (e.g., with or without cosmological constant term). First, we propose a {$ 3+1D $} topological (quantum) gravity theory which is perturbatively renormalizable and potentially UV complete, this step can be regarded as a straightforward generalization of Edward Witten{'}s Chern-Simons theory proposal for {$ 2+1D $} topological gravity. Then, we show that Einstein-Cartan equation and classical space-time naturally emerge from topological (quantum) gravity via loop condensation. The second step is a unique feature in {$ 3+1D $} and it might even naturally explain why our space-time is four dimensional. Experimentally measurable low energy predictions are also discussed.},

The topological nature of this phase naturally leads to the explanation of many of the puzzles of early universe cosmology. A concrete realization of this scenario using Witten{'}s four dimensional topological gravity is considered. This model leads to the power spectrum of CMB fluctuations which is controlled by the conformal anomaly coefficients {$a,\; c$}. In particular the strength of the fluctuation is controlled by { $1/a$} and its tilt by {$cg^2$} where {$g$} is the coupling constant of topological gravity. The positivity of {$c$}, a consequence of unitarity, leads automatically to an IR tilt for the power spectrum. In contrast with standard inflationary models, this scenario predicts {$O(1)$} non-Gaussianities for four- and higher-point correlators and the absence of tensor modes in the CMB fluctuations.},

  ABSTRACT = {The early history of the universe might be described by a topological phase followed by a standard second phase of Einstein gravity. To study this scenario in its full generality, we consider a four-manifold of Euclidean signature in the topological phase, which shares a common boundary with a corresponding manifold of Lorentzian signature in the Einstein phase. We find that the boundary should have vanishing extrinsic curvature, whereas the manifold in the topological phase should have zero Euler number. In addition, we show that the second phase must be characterized by an initial vanishing Weyl tensor and that the standard cosmological flatness problem is not automatically solved unless a conformal invariant boundary term is added. We also characterize the scalar perturbations in the standard Einstein phase. We show that they must contain an initial non-vanishing shear component inherited from the topological phase and we estimate the non-Gaussian parameters. Finally, we argue that the topological early universe cosmology shares common features of previous ideas, such as the so-called Weyl curvature hypothesis, the universe{'}s creation out of nothing and the no-boundary proposal.},

  ABSTRACT = {The topological aspects of Einstein gravity suggest that topological invariance could be a more profound principle in understanding quantum gravity. In this work, we explore a topological supergravity action that initially describes a universe without Riemann curvature, which seems trivial. However, we made a surprising discovery by introducing a small deformation parameter {$ \lambda $}, which can be regarded as an AdS generalization of supersymmetry (SUSY). We find that the deformed topological quantum field theory (TQFT) becomes unstable at low energy, resulting in the emergence of a classical metric, whose dynamics are controlled by the Einstein equation. Our findings suggest that a quantum theory of gravity could be governed by a UV fixed point of a SUSY TQFT, and classical spacetime ceases to exist beyond the Planck scale.},

  ABSTRACT = {Dark matter is one of the deepest mystery of the universe. So far there is no natural explanation why the dark matter should exist and even dominate the universe. In this paper, we begin with a {$ 3+1D $} topological gravity theory which is super renormalizable with vanishing beta functions, then we argue that Einstein gravity can emerge by condensing loop-like excitation from the underlying topological gravity theory. In the meanwhile, the uncondensed loop-like excitations serve as a natural candidate of dark matter and a generalized Einstein equation can be derived in the presence of loop-source (dark matter) background. Surprisingly, we find that such kind of dark matter will not contribute to scalar curvature, however, it will become a source of torsion. Finally, we derive the generalized Einstein equation in the presence of Dirac field. Very different from the usual Einstein-Cartan theory, our theory further predicts that any type of normal matter, including Dirac field will not produce torsion. All these unique predictions can be tested by future experiments. Our framework suggests that topological invariant principle might play a more profound role than the well-known general covariance principle, especially towards understanding the nature of dark matter and quantum gravity in {$ 3+1D $}.},

Also, a family of global invariants of the differentiable structure of the manifold, constructed with the torsion, is identified.

  ABSTRACT = {This book grew out of a set of lecture notes on gravitational Chern–Simons (CS) theories developed over the past decade for several schools and different audiences including graduate students and researchers. CS theories are gauge-invariant theories that can include gravity consistently. They are only defined in odd dimensions and represent a very special class of theories in the Lovelock family. Lovelock gravitation theories are the natural extensions of General Relativity for dimensions greater than four that yield second-order field equations for the metric. These theories also admit local supersymmetric extensions where supersymmetry is an off-shell symmetry of the action, as in a standard gauge theory. Apart from the arguments of mathematical elegance and beauty, the gravitational CS actions are exceptionally endowed with physical attributes that suggest the viability of a quantum interpretation. CS theories are gauge-invariant , scale-invariant and background independent; they have no dimensional coupling constants. All constants in the Lagrangian are fixed rational coefficients that cannot be adjusted without destroying gauge invariance. This exceptional status of CS systems makes them classically interesting to study, and quantum mechanically intriguing and promising.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this review, we consider first-order gravity in four dimensions. In particular, we focus our attention in formulations where the fundamental variables are a tetrad {$ \tensor{e }{^I_a}$} and a {$ SO(3,1) $} connection {$ \tensor{\omega}{_{aI}^J} $}. We study the most general action principle compatible with diffeomorphism invariance. This implies, in particular, considering besides the standard Einstein–Hilbert–Palatini term, other terms that either do not change the equations of motion, or are topological in nature. Having a well defined action principle sometimes involves the need for additional boundary terms , whose detailed form may depend on the particular boundary conditions at hand. In this work, we consider spacetimes that include a boundary at infinity, satisfying asymptotically flat boundary conditions and/or an internal boundary satisfying isolated horizons boundary conditions. We focus on the covariant Hamiltonian formalism where the phase space {$ \Gamma $} is given by solutions to the equations of motion. For each of the possible terms contributing to the action, we consider the well-posedness of the action, its finiteness, the contribution to the symplectic structure, and the Hamiltonian and Noether charges. For the chosen boundary conditions, standard boundary terms warrant a well posed theory. Furthermore, the boundary and topological terms do not contribute to the symplectic structure, nor the Hamiltonian conserved charges. The Noether conserved charges, on the other hand, do depend on such additional terms. The aim of this manuscript is to present a comprehensive and self-contained treatment of the subject, so the style is somewhat pedagogical. Furthermore, along the way, we point out and clarify some issues that have not been clearly understood in the literature.},

  ABSTRACT = {There are essentially two different approaches to the axiomatization of quantum field theory (QFT): algebraic QFT, going back to Haag and Kastler, and functorial QFT, going back to Atiyah and Segal. More recently, based on ideas by Baez and Dolan, the latter is being refined to \mkbibquote{extended} functorial QFT by Freed, Hopkins, Lurie and others. The first approach uses local nets of operator algebras which assign to each patch an algebra \mkbibquote{of observables}, the latter uses { $n$}-functors which assign to each patch a \mkbibquote{propagator of states}. In this note we present an observation about how these two axiom systems are naturally related: we demonstrate under mild assumptions that every 2-dimensional extended Minkowskian QFT 2-functor (\mkbibquote{parallel surface transport}) naturally yields a local net. This is obtained by postcomposing the propagation 2-functor with an operation that mimics the passage from the \textit{Schrödinger picture} to the \textit{Heisenberg picture} in quantum mechanics. The argument has a straightforward generalization to general Lorentzian structure, bare lightcone structure and higher dimensions. It does not, however, by itself imply anything about the existence of a vacuum state or about positive energy representations.},

Our chronology ends around 2000, with just a taste of later developments such as open-closed topological string theory, the categorification of quantum groups, Khovanov homology, and Lurie {'}s work on the classification of topological quantum field theories.},

Although leading to a more complicated Hamiltonian constraint this modified version, in which the configuration variable still is a connection, has the advantage of being real. In this article we derive Barbero{'}s Hamiltonian formulation from an action, which can be considered as a generalization of the ordinary Hilbert-Palatini action.},

@ARTICLE{chandia1997a,
  ABSTRACT = {In a spacetime with nonvanishing torsion there can occur topologically stable configurations associated with the frame bundle which are independent of the curvature. The relevant topological invariants are integrals of local scalar densities first discussed by Nieh and Yan (N-Y). In four dimensions, the N-Y form {$ N = \left( T_a T^a - R_{ab} e^a e^b \right) $} is the only closed 4-form invariant under local Lorentz rotations associated with the torsion of the manifold. The integral of {$ N $} over a compact {$ D $}-dimensional (Euclidean) manifold is shown to be a topological invariant related to the Pontryagin classes of {$ SO(D+1) $} and {$ SO(D) $}. An explicit example of a topologically nontrivial configuration carrying nonvanishing instanton number proportional to {$ \int N $} is constructed. The chiral anomaly in a four-dimensional spacetime with torsion is also shown to contain a contribution proportional to {$ N $}, besides the usual Pontryagin density related to the spacetime curvature. The violation of chiral symmetry can thus depend on the instanton number of the tangent frame bundle of the manifold. Similar invariants can be constructed in {$ D>4 $} dimensions and the existence of the corresponding nontrivial excitations is also discussed.},

@ARTICLE{nieh2007a,
  ABSTRACT = {Curvature and torsion are the two tensors characterizing a general Riemannian space–time. In Einstein{'}s general theory of gravitation, with torsion postulated to vanish and the affine connection identified to the Christoffel symbol, only the curvature tensor plays the central role. For such a purely metric geometry , two well-known topological invariants, namely the Euler class and the Pontryagin class, are useful in characterizing the topological properties of the space–time. From a gauge theory point of view, and especially in the presence of spin, torsion naturally comes into play, and the underlying space–time is no longer purely metric. We describe a torsional topological invariant, discovered in 1982, that has now found increasing usefulness in recent developments.},

@BOOK{piguet1995b,
  ABSTRACT = {The idea of this book originated from two series of lectures given by us at the Physics Department of the Catholic University of Petr{ ô}polis, in Brazil. Its aim is to present an introduction to the \mkbibquote{algebraic} method in the perturbative renormalization of relativistic quantum field theory. Although this approach goes back to the pioneering works of Symanzik in the early 1970s and was systematized by Becchi, Rouet and Stora as early as 1972-1974, its full value has not yet been widely appreciated by the practitioners of quantum field theory. Becchi, Rouet and Stora have, however, shown it to be a powerful tool for proving the renormalizability of theories with (broken) symmetries and of gauge theories. We have thus found it pertinent to collect in a self-contained manner the available information on algebraic renormalization, which was previously scattered in many original papers and in a few older review articles. Although we have taken care to adapt the level of this book to that of a postgraduate (Ph.D.) course, more advanced researchers will also certainly find it useful. The deeper knowledge of renormalization theory we hope readers will acquire should help them to face the difficult problems of quantum field theory. It should also be very helpful to the more phenomenology oriented readers who want to familiarize themselves with the formalism of renormalization theory, a necessity in view of the sophisticated perturbative calculations currently being done, in particular in the standard model of particle interactions.},
